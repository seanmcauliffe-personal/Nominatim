Nominatim (from the Latin, 'by name') is a tool to search OSM data by name and
address and to generate synthetic addresses of OSM points (reverse geocoding).
It has also limited capability to search features by their type
(pubs, hotels, churches, etc).

This guide comes in five parts:

* __[API reference](api/Overview.md)__ for users of Nominatim
* __[Administration Guide](admin/Installation.md)__ for those who want
   to install their own Nominatim server
* __[Customization Guide](customize/Overview.md)__ for those who want to
   adapt their own installation to their special requirements
* __[Library Guide](library/Getting-Started.md)__ for Python developers who
   want to use Nominatim as a library in their project
* __[Developer's Guide](develop/overview.md)__ for developers of the software
