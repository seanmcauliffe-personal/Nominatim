Nominatim
=========

Nominatim (from the Latin, 'by name') is a tool to search OpenStreetMap data
by name and address (geocoding) and to generate synthetic addresses of
OSM points (reverse geocoding). An instance with up-to-date data can be found
at <https://nominatim.openstreetmap.org>. Nominatim is also used as one of the
sources for the Search box on the OpenStreetMap home page.

Documentation

The documentation of the latest development version is in the
`docs/` subdirectory. A HTML version can be found at
<https://nominatim.org/release-docs/develop/> .

        ./nominatim-venv/bin/pip install packaging/nominatim-{api,db}

2. Create a project directory, get OSM data and import:

        mkdir nominatim-project
        cd nominatim-project
        ../nominatim-venv/bin/nominatim import --osm-file <your planet file>

3. Start the webserver:
