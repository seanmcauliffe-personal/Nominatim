<!-- Make sure that the data you are looking for is in OpenStreetMap. Provide a link to the OpenStreetMap object or if you cannot get it, a link to the map on https://openstreetmap.org where you expect the result to be.

To get the link to the OSM object, you can try the following:

 * Go to [https://openstreetmap.org](https://openstreetmap.org).
 * Move to the area of the map where you expect the result and then zoom in as much as possible.
 * Click on the question mark on the right side of the map. You get a question cursor. Use it to click on the map where your object is located.
 * Find the object of interest in the list that appears on the left side.
 * Click on the object and report back the URL that the browser shows.
